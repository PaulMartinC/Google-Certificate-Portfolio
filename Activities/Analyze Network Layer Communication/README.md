# Scenario 
For this project, I analyzed captured network data packets, simulating the use of a network analyzer tool, to identify the network protocol and service affected by the incident. I then prepared a follow-up report detailing my findings to document the incident for the IT team.

Through this process, I successfully examined and interpreted network traffic and data to diagnose network-related issues during cybersecurity incidents. This experience has advanced my ability to assess security events, bringing me closer to effectively managing and resolving such incidents. For this project, my focus was solely on analyzing the situation rather than implementing a resolution.
